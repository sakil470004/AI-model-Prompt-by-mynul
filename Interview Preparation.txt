Soft Skills & Experience-based Scenarios

Guidelines:
Make the interview continuous â€” after each question, provide the answer as if I (the candidate) am responding correctly, then immediately ask the next question.

Cover beginner to advanced difficulty, mixing:

Theory questions

Coding challenges (small ones that can be solved quickly)

Debugging scenarios

Project-based questions
Details guideline:
1. Technical Interview Questions
   - JavaScript fundamentals
   - React concepts and patterns
   - Node.js and Express
   - Database concepts
   - Data structures and algorithms
   - System design basics

2. Practical Coding Challenges
   - Frontend implementations
   - React component creation
   - API integration
   - Database queries
   - Common coding patterns

3. System Design
   - Basic architecture discussions
   - Database design
   - API design
   - Frontend architecture
   - Performance optimization

4. Behavioral Questions
   - Project discussions
   - Problem-solving approaches
   - Team collaboration
